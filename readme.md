# ASP.NET Core Authentication

The only purpose of this sample is to show how to configure authentication via Identity Provider (OpenID Connect) within ASP.NET Core Web Application/API project.
The web app uses GitHub as an example of a public identity provider, but you can replace GitHub with any other provider, but üêª in mind, that every provider might require a different configuration.

The list of community driven identity providers can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/aspnet-contrib/AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers/tree/dev/src) and/or [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/aspnet-contrib).
